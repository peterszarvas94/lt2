## Hi there

My name is PÃ©ter Szarvas, I work as a freelancer, as a fullstack developer in
Hungray.

First I stared with JavaScript/TypeScript and frontend frameworks like
React, Astro, I have built some projects with this stack. But over time my
interest is shifted to Go, and server driven, traditional server-client
applications.

This interest led me to build **lytepage**, as an alternative to client-side
frameworks, to have a simple tool to build static sites.

This very page you are visiting, is built using **lytepage**, as well as my
website, see below.
